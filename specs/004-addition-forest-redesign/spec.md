# Feature Specification: Addition Forest Visual Redesign

**Feature Branch**: `004-addition-forest-redesign`  
**Created**: 2025-10-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I would like to completely revamp the graphics of the Addition Forest. Could you change the 'treasure map' to a simple linear progression, with a line from the left to the right, where the first item on the line is the castle you already drew? All in all there can be 10 items on the line. I want this 'world' to be visually appealing, and I don't think it is right now. Please think of ways to make it better-looking."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Linear Progression Navigation (Priority: P1)

A child or parent opens the Addition Forest map and immediately understands the learning path as a simple, clear horizontal line from left to right, with the castle as the starting point and 9 additional visually distinct stations along the way.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation of the redesign - replacing the confusing winding treasure map with an intuitive linear progression that matches how children naturally read and process sequential information (left to right).

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading the Addition Forest map page and verifying that all 10 stations appear in a horizontal line from left to right, starting with the castle, without needing any interaction functionality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user visits the Addition Forest map page, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see a clear horizontal line from left to right with exactly 10 visually distinct stations
2. **Given** the horizontal progression is displayed, **When** the user looks at the leftmost position, **Then** they see the castle graphic as station 1
3. **Given** the map is displayed, **When** the user views the progression line, **Then** each station has a unique, appealing visual design that differentiates it from other stations
4. **Given** the map is displayed on different screen sizes, **When** the viewport changes, **Then** the linear progression adjusts responsively while maintaining left-to-right order and visual clarity

### User Story 2 - Enhanced Visual Appeal (Priority: P2)

A child using the Addition Forest feels excited and motivated by the visually appealing graphics, including themed station designs (e.g., castle, fountain, garden, tower) that tell a visual story across the forest journey.

**Why this priority**: Visual appeal directly impacts engagement and motivation. Children are more likely to return to and complete exercises when the environment feels magical and inviting.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by showing the map to target users (children aged 5-8) and their parents, gathering qualitative feedback on visual appeal and comparing it to the current treasure map design.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the redesigned map is displayed, **When** users view each station, **Then** each station has a distinct thematic design (e.g., castle, tree house, fountain, flower garden, bridge, windmill, lighthouse, pond, tower, treasure chest)
2. **Given** a user progresses through stations, **When** they unlock a new station, **Then** the visual transition uses appealing animations and color changes that provide positive reinforcement
3. **Given** the map background and surroundings, **When** displayed, **Then** they include cohesive forest-themed decorative elements (trees, bushes, flowers, animals) that enhance the aesthetic without cluttering the interface
4. **Given** the color palette used across all stations, **When** viewed together, **Then** it maintains visual harmony and accessibility (sufficient contrast, colorblind-friendly)

### User Story 3 - Clear Progress Indication (Priority: P2)

A child can instantly see which stations they've completed, which station is currently active, and which stations are still locked, through clear visual distinctions along the linear progression.

**Why this priority**: Progress visibility is crucial for motivation and goal-setting. Children need to see their achievements and understand what's next.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating different progress states (0 completed, 3 completed, 5 completed, all completed) and verifying that the visual distinctions are immediately clear without text labels.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has completed 0 stations, **When** they view the map, **Then** station 1 (castle) is highlighted as active, and stations 2-10 appear locked/inactive with reduced opacity and color saturation
2. **Given** a user has completed 3 stations, **When** they view the map, **Then** stations 1-3 show completion indicators (e.g., checkmarks, stars, full color), station 4 is highlighted as active, and stations 5-10 appear locked
3. **Given** a user hovers over or focuses on any station, **When** interaction occurs, **Then** appropriate visual feedback appears (glow, scale, or highlight) if the station is accessible
4. **Given** a user completes all 10 stations, **When** they view the map, **Then** all stations show completion indicators and a special celebratory visual effect plays

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the viewport is very narrow (mobile portrait mode) and cannot fit all 10 stations horizontally?
  - The map should either allow horizontal scrolling or stack stations vertically on small screens while maintaining order
- How does the system handle users with screen readers or keyboard-only navigation?
  - Each station must have proper ARIA labels, keyboard focus states, and logical tab order from left to right
- What happens if a user has partially completed a station (e.g., answered 3 out of 5 questions)?
  - The station should show a partial completion indicator (e.g., progress ring, partially filled icon) distinct from fully complete or locked states
- How does the map appear when JavaScript is disabled or loading?
  - A fallback static view should show the 10 stations in order with clear numbering and basic styling

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Assumptions

- The existing exercise interaction functionality (questions, answers, feedback) will remain unchanged - only the map visualization is being redesigned
- The current progress tracking mechanism (localStorage or similar) will continue to work with 10 stations instead of 5
- All 10 stations will use the same exercise format and difficulty level initially; unique content per station is out of scope for this redesign
- Users access the application through modern web browsers that support standard web graphics capabilities
- The target age group (5-8 years old) can use standard mouse/touch and keyboard input methods
- The forest/fantasy theme remains appropriate for the educational content

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display exactly 10 stations arranged in a horizontal linear progression from left to right
- **FR-002**: System MUST position the existing castle graphic as the first station (leftmost position) in the progression
- **FR-003**: System MUST give each of the 10 stations a unique, visually distinct thematic design that fits the forest/fantasy theme
- **FR-004**: System MUST use even horizontal spacing between stations to create a clear sense of progression
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain the existing progress tracking functionality that determines which stations are locked, active, or completed
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide clear visual differentiation between three station states: completed (with indicator), active/current (highlighted), and locked/inactive (reduced visibility)
- **FR-007**: System MUST ensure the linear progression line connecting stations is clearly visible and guides the eye from left to right
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain responsive layout that adapts the map to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- **FR-009**: System MUST preserve keyboard navigation and screen reader accessibility with proper ARIA labels and focus management
- **FR-010**: System MUST include thematic decorative background elements (trees, bushes, flowers, animals) that enhance visual appeal without obscuring station visibility
- **FR-011**: System MUST use a cohesive color palette that provides sufficient contrast for accessibility while maintaining visual harmony
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain or improve performance compared to the current treasure map implementation
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide smooth visual transitions when stations unlock or are completed
- **FR-014**: System MUST preserve the existing interaction behavior where clicking the castle (station 1) opens the exercise interface
