# Tasks: Addition Forest Visual Redesign

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-addition-forest-redesign/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/ui-station-graphics.md

**Tests**: Not required per constitution (frontend-only feature, manual testing only)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Frontend web app**: `frontend/` at repository root
- All paths relative to repository root

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and preparation for redesign

- [ ] T001 Review current implementation in frontend/worlds/addition-forest-map.html to understand existing structure
- [ ] T002 Review current CSS in frontend/styles/map.css to identify styles to preserve vs replace
- [ ] T003 [P] Review exercise-state.js in frontend/scripts/exercise-state.js to understand progress tracking mechanism
- [ ] T004 [P] Create backup branch or tag of current working implementation before major changes

**Checkpoint**: Understanding of current system complete, ready to begin redesign

---

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Linear Progression Navigation (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Users see a clear horizontal line from left to right with exactly 10 visually distinct stations, starting with the castle

**Independent Test**: Load frontend/worlds/addition-forest-map.html in browser and verify all 10 stations appear in horizontal line from left to right, starting with castle at position 1

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Clear Progress Indication (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Users can instantly see completed (with checkmark), active (highlighted), and locked (reduced opacity) stations

**Independent Test**: Simulate different progress states in localStorage and verify visual distinctions are immediately clear

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T054 [US3] Add @media (prefers-reduced-motion) to disable animations in frontend/styles/animations.css
- [ ] T055 [US3] Verify screen reader announces state changes using VoiceOver/NVDA

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional - complete visual redesign with clear progress

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories and final quality checks

- [ ] T056 [P] Verify exercise interaction still works - click station 1 (castle) opens exercise in frontend/worlds/addition-forest-map.html
- [ ] T057 [P] Test completing station 1 unlocks station 2 correctly via exercise-state.js

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (Linear Progression) can start after Foundational
  - US2 (Visual Appeal) can start after US1 basic structure exists (uses placeholder stations)
  - US3 (Progress Indication) can start after US1 basic structure exists
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Depends on US1 basic station structure (T012-T021) - Replaces placeholders with themed graphics
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Depends on US1 basic station structure (T012-T021) - Adds state styling to existing stations

### Within Each User Story

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (Tasks T001-T004) - ~30 minutes
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (Tasks T005-T011) - ~1 hour
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Tasks T012-T026) - ~2-3 hours
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
   - Load page in browser
   - Verify 10 stations in horizontal line
   - Test responsive behavior at 320px, 768px, 1920px
   - Test keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter)
5. Deploy/demo if ready - **THIS IS YOUR MVP!**

**Estimated MVP Time**: 4-5 hours

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation** (Setup + Foundational) ‚Üí Structure ready (~1.5 hours)
2. **MVP** (+ User Story 1) ‚Üí 10 stations visible, responsive (~3 hours more = 4.5 hours total)
3. **Beautiful** (+ User Story 2) ‚Üí Themed graphics, decorative elements (~3-4 hours more = 7.5-8.5 hours total)
4. **Complete** (+ User Story 3) ‚Üí Clear progress states (~2-3 hours more = 9.5-11.5 hours total)
5. **Polished** (+ Phase 6) ‚Üí Tested, accessible, performant (~1-2 hours more = 10.5-13.5 hours total)

Each story adds value without breaking previous stories.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Together**: Complete Setup + Foundational (Tasks T001-T011)
2. **Once Foundational is done, split work**:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (T012-T026) - Basic structure
   - **Developer B**: User Story 2 (T027-T042) - Wait for US1 basic structure, then add themed graphics
   - **Developer C**: User Story 3 (T043-T055) - Wait for US1 basic structure, then add state styles
3. **Together**: Polish phase (T056-T071) after all stories complete

**Estimated Parallel Time**: 6-8 hours (vs 10.5-13.5 hours sequential)

- Verify background has trees, bushes, flowers
- Check color contrast with browser dev tools (WCAG AA)
- Ask target age group for feedback on visual appeal

**User Story 3 Test**:
- Clear localStorage, reload: Station 1 active, 2-10 locked (40% opacity)
- Set progress to 3 complete: Stations 1-3 show checkmarks, 4 active, 5-10 locked
- Set progress to all complete: All show checkmarks
- Hover/focus active station: See glow effect

### Suggested MVP Scope

**Minimum Viable Product = User Story 1 only (Tasks T001-T026)**

This delivers:
- ‚úÖ 10 stations in horizontal linear progression
- ‚úÖ Clear left-to-right navigation

Users can immediately see and understand the new linear progression, even with basic circles as station graphics. This proves the core concept and can be deployed for early feedback.

**Time to MVP**: ~4-5 hours

**Enhanced Product** = MVP + User Story 2 (add Tasks T027-T042)
- Adds beautiful themed station graphics
- Adds decorative forest elements
- **Time**: +3-4 hours (7.5-8.5 hours total)

**Complete Product** = Enhanced + User Story 3 (add Tasks T043-T055)
- Adds clear progress indication with animations
- **Time**: +2-3 hours (9.5-11.5 hours total)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files or independent sections, no dependencies
- [Story] label (US1/US2/US3) maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- No automated tests per constitution - manual testing throughout
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- SVG graphics follow contracts/ui-station-graphics.md specifications
- All localization uses existing i18n.js system
- Performance target: <2s load, 60fps animations
- Accessibility target: WCAG AA, keyboard nav, screen reader support
