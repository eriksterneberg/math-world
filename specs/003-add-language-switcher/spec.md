# Feature Specification: Language Switcher

## Short Name
add-language-switcher

## Feature Description
Add a language switcher to the interface (same on every page) that controls which language is used. Store the selected language in LocalStorage. The switcher must update the interface language immediately and persist the choice across reloads and page changes.

## Actors
- User (student, teacher, visitor)

## User Scenarios & Testing
- User visits any page and sees a language switcher (e.g., dropdown or buttons)
- User selects a language (e.g., English or Swedish)
- The interface updates to the selected language immediately
- The choice is saved in localStorage and persists across reloads and page changes
- On next visit, the site loads in the previously selected language

## Functional Requirements
- FR1: Add a language switcher UI element to every page (visible, accessible, and consistent placement)
- FR2: When a user selects a language, update all i18n text on the page immediately
- FR3: Store the selected language in localStorage under a clear key (e.g., mathworld.language)
- FR4: On page load, check localStorage for a saved language and use it if present; otherwise, use browser default
- FR5: The language switcher must be keyboard accessible and screen-reader friendly
- FR6: The switcher must support at least English and Swedish, and be extensible for more languages

## Success Criteria
- Users can change the language from any page in â‰¤2 clicks
- The interface updates to the selected language within 1 second
- The selected language persists after reload and across all pages
- The switcher is accessible (tab/keyboard, ARIA labels)
- No implementation details (frameworks, code) in requirements

## Key Entities
- LanguageSwitcher (UI component)
- LanguagePreference (localStorage key/value)
- i18n system (existing)

## Assumptions
- All pages load i18n.js and have access to the same localStorage
- Only two languages are required for MVP (en, sv), but more may be added later
- The switcher will be placed in a consistent location (e.g., header or fixed corner)

## Out of Scope
- Adding new languages beyond English and Swedish for MVP
- Server-side language persistence
- User account integration

## Dependencies
- Existing i18n.js localization system
- localStorage browser API

## Edge Cases
- User disables localStorage: falls back to browser language for each session
- User selects a language not available: fallback to English
- User changes language rapidly: interface must remain stable and responsive

## Success Metrics
- 100% of users can see and use the language switcher on every page
- 100% of language changes are reflected within 1 second
- 100% of language choices persist after reload and across navigation
- 100% keyboard accessibility (tab, enter, arrow keys)
- 0 accessibility violations (screen reader, ARIA)
