# Requirements Quality Checklist: Language Switcher

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before planning/implementation
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Requirement Completeness
- [x] CHK001 - Are all user scenarios for language switching (selection, persistence, update) explicitly documented? [Completeness, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [x] CHK002 - Are all functional requirements for UI, persistence, and accessibility of the language switcher specified? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [x] CHK003 - Are dependencies on i18n system and localStorage clearly stated? [Completeness, Spec §Dependencies]

## Requirement Clarity
- [x] CHK004 - Is the expected user experience for language switching described in unambiguous terms? [Clarity, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [x] CHK005 - Are the requirements for immediate interface update and persistence clearly defined? [Clarity, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [x] CHK006 - Is the scope of supported languages (English, Swedish) for MVP clearly stated? [Clarity, Spec §Assumptions]

## Requirement Consistency
- [x] CHK007 - Are requirements for language switcher UI, persistence, and accessibility consistent across all sections? [Consistency]
- [x] CHK008 - Are success criteria and acceptance criteria aligned with functional requirements? [Consistency, Spec §Success Criteria, §Acceptance Criteria]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality
- [x] CHK009 - Are all success criteria measurable and technology-agnostic? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [x] CHK010 - Are acceptance criteria defined for all functional requirements? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §Acceptance Criteria]

## Scenario Coverage
- [x] CHK011 - Are primary, alternate, and exception flows for language switching covered in requirements? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [x] CHK012 - Are requirements defined for persistence failure or unavailable localStorage? [Coverage, Edge Case]

## Edge Case Coverage
- [x] CHK013 - Are fallback behaviors specified for unavailable or unsupported languages? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [x] CHK014 - Are requirements defined for rapid language changes or toggling? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non-Functional Requirements
- [x] CHK015 - Are accessibility requirements (keyboard, ARIA) for the switcher specified? [Non-Functional, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [x] CHK016 - Is the performance expectation for language update (≤1 second) defined? [Non-Functional, Spec §Success Criteria]

## Dependencies & Assumptions
- [x] CHK017 - Are all dependencies (i18n.js, localStorage) and assumptions (browser support, extensibility) documented? [Dependencies, Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts
- [x] CHK018 - Are all ambiguous terms (e.g., "immediately", "accessible") clarified or quantified? [Ambiguity, Spec §Functional Requirements, §Success Criteria]
- [x] CHK019 - Are there any conflicting requirements between UI, accessibility, and persistence? [Conflict]

**Total items: 19**

**Each run creates a new checklist file.**

**Focus areas:** Requirements completeness, clarity, consistency, acceptance criteria, scenario/edge case coverage, non-functional requirements, dependencies, ambiguities/conflicts.
**Depth:** Standard (suitable for author and reviewer use)
**Actor/timing:** Author/reviewer, pre-implementation
**Explicit must-haves:** Accessibility, persistence, measurable success criteria, edge case handling
