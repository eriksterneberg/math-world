## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Pattern

**Functional Modular Architecture**
- `exercise-state.js`: Pure state management functions
- `question-generator.js`: Pure question generation logic
- `castle-exercise.js`: UI coordination layer
- No classes, only functions (Constitution Principle I)

### State Management

```javascript
// State structure stored in localStorage
{
  currentStateCode: "1.1.5",  // world.exercise.question
  totalCorrect: 4,
  totalAttempts: 6,
  recentQuestions: [
    {a: 12, b: 18},
    {a: 25, b: 14},
    // ... last 10 questions
  ],
  lastUpdated: "2025-01-25T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

### Progressive Difficulty Algorithm

```javascript
// Questions get harder as student progresses
- Q1-4:   sum 10-40  (e.g., 12 + 18 = 30)
- Q5-10:  sum 20-70  (e.g., 32 + 28 = 60)
- Q11+:   sum ≤100   (e.g., 47 + 53 = 100)
```

### Deduplication System

- Tracks last 10 questions
- Order-independent comparison (12+18 == 18+12)
- Up to 100 retry attempts to find unique question
- Ensures variety in practice

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. **Single Exercise**: Only one castle/exercise implemented
2. **Basic Progress Tracking**: No performance metrics or analytics
3. **No Achievements**: No rewards system or badges
4. **Desktop-First**: Mobile UX could be enhanced further

### Recommended Future Work (Phase 6 - Optional Polish)
1. **Accessibility Enhancements** (T044-T049)
   - Enhanced focus indicators
   - Better ARIA live regions
   - Voice-over testing

2. **Animations & Transitions** (T050-T053)
   - Celebration animations for correct answers
   - Transition effects between questions
   - Princess character reactions

3. **Cross-Browser Testing** (T054-T057)
   - Safari-specific testing
   - Mobile browser testing (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
   - Edge case handling

4. **Additional Features** (Future Iterations)
   - More exercises (castle → forest → mountain, etc.)
   - Achievement system with badges
   - Performance analytics dashboard
   - Adaptive difficulty based on performance
   - Multiplayer mode
   - Teacher dashboard
