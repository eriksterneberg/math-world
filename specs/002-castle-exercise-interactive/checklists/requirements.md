# Specification Quality Checklist: Interactive Castle Starting Point with Addition Exercises

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 25, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Content Quality**: ✅ All items pass
- Specification avoids implementation details like specific JavaScript frameworks or localStorage implementation
- Focuses on what users need (castle interaction, princess character, addition exercises)
- Written in language accessible to teachers and educators
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**: ✅ All items pass
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are concrete
- Each requirement is testable (e.g., "castle MUST be clickable" can be verified)
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (e.g., "within 5 seconds", "500 milliseconds", "90% of students")
- Success criteria avoid implementation terms and focus on user outcomes
- 20 acceptance scenarios defined across 3 user stories
- 6 edge cases identified with clear handling approaches
- Scope is bounded to first exercise with castle and princess
- 11 assumptions documented

**Feature Readiness**: ✅ All items pass
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User scenarios cover: castle click → interaction area → question presentation → answer submission → progress persistence
- Success criteria align with feature goals (e.g., SC-001 for castle identification, SC-004 for exercise completion time)
- Specification maintains separation of concerns (what vs how)

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete, clear, testable, and free of implementation details. Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` for technical planning.
