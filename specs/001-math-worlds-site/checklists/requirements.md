# Specification Quality Checklist: Math Planet Learning Site

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 25, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review
✅ **PASS** - The specification focuses entirely on what users need (home page with world cards, map navigation) without mentioning specific technologies beyond "HTML and SVG" which is appropriately specified as a constraint for creating scenery. All content is written from a student/teacher perspective.

### Requirement Completeness Review
✅ **PASS** - All 20 functional requirements are concrete and testable (e.g., "MUST display four world cards", "MUST show animation of falling leaves when user hovers"). No clarification markers remain. All requirements answered through user input (Q1: story-based learning, Q2: ages 7-12, Q3: no progress tracking).

### Success Criteria Review
✅ **PASS** - All 7 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic:
- SC-001: "identify worlds within 5 seconds" (measurable time)
- SC-003: "navigate on first click attempt" (measurable success rate)
- SC-004: "visual feedback within 200 milliseconds" (measurable performance)
- SC-005: "displays correctly on 768px+ screens" (measurable dimension)
- SC-006: "90% of students can identify" (measurable percentage)

### Edge Cases Review
✅ **PASS** - Four edge cases identified covering: disabled card clicks, inactive map spots, responsive design, and keyboard accessibility.

### User Scenarios Review
✅ **PASS** - Three user stories with clear priorities (P1: home page, P2: interaction/navigation, P3: map view). Each story is independently testable and has 3-5 concrete acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format.

## Notes

Specification is **READY FOR PLANNING** (`/speckit.plan`). All quality criteria have been met:
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
- All requirements testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Clear scope boundaries established
- Assumptions documented based on user input
