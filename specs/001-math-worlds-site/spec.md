# Feature Specification: Math Planet Learning Site

**Feature Branch**: `001-math-worlds-site`  
**Created**: October 25, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add static HTML site with Math Planet home page and four world cards (Addition Forest, Subtraction Mountain, Multiplication Desert, Division Ocean) with scenery and animations, plus Addition Forest map page"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Home Page with World Cards (Priority: P1)

A student (aged 7-12) opens the Math Planet site and sees a welcoming home page with the title "Math Planet" and four large, visually appealing world cards representing different mathematical operations. The student can immediately identify which world is accessible (Addition Forest with animated falling leaves) and which worlds are coming soon (the other three grayed-out worlds with "Coming soon" text).

**Why this priority**: This is the entry point to the entire learning experience. Without this, users cannot access any content. It establishes the theme, visual style, and navigation structure of the entire site.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the home page in a browser and verifying all four world cards are displayed with correct colors, scenery, and interactivity status. Delivers immediate value by presenting the learning structure to users.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student opens the Math Planet site, **When** the home page loads, **Then** the page displays "Math Planet" as the title
2. **Given** the home page is displayed, **When** the student views the page, **Then** four large world cards are shown: Addition Forest (greenish colors), Subtraction Mountain (whitish/snow colors), Multiplication Desert (yellow colors), and Division Ocean (blue colors)
3. **Given** the student views the world cards, **When** they look at Addition Forest, **Then** it appears active and clickable with forest scenery visible
4. **Given** the student views the world cards, **When** they look at Subtraction Mountain, Multiplication Desert, and Division Ocean, **Then** all three appear grayed out with "Coming soon" text and are not clickable
5. **Given** the student views the world cards, **When** they read the cards, **Then** each card displays its world name in an attractive, readable font

---

### User Story 2 - Interact with Addition Forest Card (Priority: P2)

A student views the Addition Forest card on the home page and hovers their mouse over it. The card responds with an animated visual effect (falling leaves) that makes the learning environment feel engaging and interactive. The student clicks on the card and is taken to the Addition Forest map page.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary interaction that leads students into the learning content. The animation provides immediate feedback and engagement, making the site feel alive and inviting. This is essential for the first active learning world.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by hovering over the Addition Forest card and verifying the falling leaves animation appears, then clicking to confirm navigation to the map page. Delivers value by providing an engaging, interactive experience that encourages exploration.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the student is viewing the home page, **When** they hover their mouse over the Addition Forest card, **Then** an animation of falling leaves begins playing
2. **Given** the falling leaves animation is playing, **When** the student moves their mouse away from the card, **Then** the animation stops
3. **Given** the student sees the Addition Forest card, **When** they click on it, **Then** they are navigated to the Addition Forest map page

### User Story 3 - View Addition Forest Map (Priority: P3)

A student who clicked on the Addition Forest card arrives at a new page showing a treasure map-style view of the Addition Forest. The map displays five distinct spots (learning locations) arranged in a path-like progression. The first spot is visually highlighted to indicate it's the starting point, though it is not yet clickable. The other four spots are visible but not highlighted, showing the learning path ahead.

**Why this priority**: This establishes the progression structure within each world and gives students a sense of their learning journey. While important for the overall experience, it can be developed after the home page is functional. The map itself is currently informational only (no interactivity), so it's lower priority than the active home page elements.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by clicking the Addition Forest card from the home page and verifying the map page displays with five spots and correct highlighting. Delivers value by showing students the learning path structure and creating anticipation for future content.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the student clicked on Addition Forest, **When** the map page loads, **Then** a treasure map-style layout is displayed with forest theming
2. **Given** the map page is displayed, **When** the student views the map, **Then** five distinct spots are visible on the map
3. **Given** the five spots are visible, **When** the student looks at the first spot, **Then** it appears highlighted compared to the other four spots
4. **Given** the student sees the highlighted first spot, **When** they try to click on it, **Then** nothing happens (it is not yet interactive)
5. **Given** the student views the map, **When** they look at spots 2-5, **Then** they appear visible but not highlighted

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a student tries to click on the grayed-out world cards (Subtraction Mountain, Multiplication Desert, Division Ocean)? The cards should not respond to clicks or show any hover effects.
- What happens when a student tries to interact with spots 2-5 on the Addition Forest map? Nothing should happen as these are not yet active or clickable.
- How does the site display on different screen sizes? The world cards should remain readable and the map should be viewable on tablets and larger mobile devices (targeting 7-12 year olds who typically use tablets or computers for learning).
- What happens when a student uses keyboard navigation? The Addition Forest card should be keyboard accessible (focusable and activatable with Enter/Space keys).

- **World Card**: A visual navigation element on the home page representing a world. Contains scenery illustration, world name, activation status, hover behavior, and navigation target.
- **Map Spot**: A location on the Addition Forest map representing a future learning activity. Contains position on map, highlight status, and activation status.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Students can identify all four mathematical operation worlds within 5 seconds of viewing the home page
- **SC-002**: Students can distinguish between the active world (Addition Forest) and inactive worlds (the other three) through visual cues alone
- **SC-003**: Students successfully navigate from the home page to the Addition Forest map page on their first click attempt
- **SC-004**: The falling leaves animation on the Addition Forest card provides smooth visual feedback within 200 milliseconds of hovering
- **SC-005**: Site displays correctly and remains readable on screen sizes from 768px width and above (tablet and desktop)
- **SC-006**: 90% of students in the target age group (7-12 years) can identify which world they can currently explore without additional instruction
- **SC-007**: Visual scenery for each world clearly represents its theme (forest, mountain with snow, desert, ocean) to students in the target age group

## Assumptions

- **A-001**: Target users have access to modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) released within the last 2 years
- **A-002**: Target users primarily access the site on tablets (iPad-sized) or desktop computers, not smartphones
- **A-003**: No user authentication, accounts, or progress tracking is needed at this stage
- **A-004**: The story-based learning approach means each spot on the map will eventually contain narrative-driven addition challenges (based on user answer to Q1: B)
- **A-005**: Site is designed for students aged 7-12 years old, with UI complexity appropriate for this age range (based on user answer to Q2)
- **A-006**: No browser storage or data persistence is required; users start fresh each visit (based on user answer to Q3: A)
- **A-007**: The site will be expanded later with backend functionality, so the structure should allow for future enhancement without major redesign
- **A-008**: Keyboard accessibility is important for students who may have difficulty using a mouse
- **A-009**: The site should use web-standard animations (CSS animations or SVG animations) that work without JavaScript when possible
